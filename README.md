## Notes

- The latest version of Hugo `v0.145.0` causes some errors so we use `dpkg` and the GitHub repo to download an older version `v0.127.0` instead
- The `yaml` file is a GitHub actions workflow that automates the build and deployment process to GitHub Pages
- Modify the `hugo.toml` for site settings

## Guides

The follow tutorials were used to learn Hugo and Github Pages:
- [Ed theme](https://gohugo-theme-ed.netlify.app/documentation/)
