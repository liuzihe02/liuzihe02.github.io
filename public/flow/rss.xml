      <description>A swallow, generated by GPT. 思念如燕 它飞舞舌尖 若是真爱 配尝几分苦甜 意念婆娑 时间里推磨 追随到何处才结果 燕如针线 在青空缝编 几幅女红将以泪缀点 誓言斑驳 情雾只是经过 风雨中且让我 盈步 婀娜 Olivia Ong/王俪婷&#xA;Recently I did a pretty difficult thing. I put in alot of effort into it, and it paid off. Sure, it came with a couple of trade-offs, but it was well worth it in comparison. I tried really hard to get better at this one other thing (dance), but fell short of my own goals.</description>

      <description>The Fallen Angel by Alexandre Cabanel (Wikipedia) Excerpt from Paradise Lost, by John Milton&#xA;What though the field be lost? All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate, And courage never to submit or yield: And what is else not to be overcome? I didn&amp;rsquo;t read Paradise Lost, but I found this painting of Lucifer that was inspired by Paradise Lost somewhat soul-stirring. We see Lucifer&amp;rsquo;s intense gaze as he looks (at the viewer?</description>

      <description>Composed and written by Jhung&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s always the end when I see things different Always the end when I see you OK last take, last take 2,3 Then you come in like this La-la-la, la-da-da Please! Don&amp;rsquo;t you forget about me, no Cause I can&amp;rsquo;t let this go Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to let me know Nowadays, a significant portion of my time and energy is channelled to dancing. One thought occurs fairly often to me recently, as I start to see frontier AI models get increasingly intertwined within the lives of the people around me.</description>

      <description>I like a dog at my feet when I read, Whatever his size or whatever his breed. A dog now and then that will nuzzle my hand As though I were the greatest of men in the land, And trying to tell me it’s pleasant to be On such intimate terms with a fellow like me. I like a dog at my side when I eat, I like to give him a bit of my meat; And though mother objects and insists it is bad To let dogs in the dining room, still I am glad To behold him stretched out on the floor by my chair.</description>
