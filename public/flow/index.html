            <p>This is a space to document my thoughts around music.</p>
<hr>
<p>Music occupies a big part of my life, from when I was singing in my school choir, to my current obsession with hip hop dance. Out of any medium (with the possible exception of film), I don&rsquo;t think any medium has generated within me the kind of emotions that music can. Throughout the years, all sorts of sounds - various genres, expressions, and cultures - has been my constant companion. I&rsquo;m grateful for that. I wanted to dedicate a space to document that experience, and I suppose this is it. Kind of, at least. For now, this space contains song lyrics and how they made me think and feel. Maybe one day, I&rsquo;ll also be able to produce sounds and lyrics of my own that can fill this space.</p>
<p>I named this section <em>flow</em> for a few reasons. My surname <em>Liu</em> in chinese <em>刘</em> when read aloud, can also interpreted as <em>流</em>, which means <em>flow</em> or <em>stream</em>. And if I can describe in one word how I feel in the music and dance that I love, it would exactly be that - <em>flow</em>. The way that the movements of my body and the movements of melodies connect both feel like flowing in one continuous stream. In rap music, flow also refers to the rhythms and rhymes of a song&rsquo;s lyrics and how they interact. I guess many people feel the same way as I do listening to music.</p>

Cortis. I may be slightly tipsy while writing this. I got kicked out for dancing too hard to this song. In my defence, I actually learnt the choreography and was on beat. I love my friends though. I recently realised maybe my family and friends really mean the world to me.

Recently I did a pretty difficult thing. I put in alot of effort into it, and it paid off. Sure, it came with a couple of trade-offs, but it was well worth it in comparison. I tried really hard to get better at this one other thing (dance), but fell short of my own goals.

        The Fallen Angel by Alexandre Cabanel (Wikipedia) Excerpt from Paradise Lost, by John Milton
What though the field be lost? All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate, And courage never to submit or yield: And what is else not to be overcome? I didn&rsquo;t read Paradise Lost, but I found this painting of Lucifer that was inspired by Paradise Lost somewhat soul-stirring. We see Lucifer&rsquo;s intense gaze as he looks (at the viewer?

It&rsquo;s always the end when I see things different Always the end when I see you OK last take, last take 2,3 Then you come in like this La-la-la, la-da-da Please! Don&rsquo;t you forget about me, no Cause I can&rsquo;t let this go Don&rsquo;t forget to let me know Nowadays, a significant portion of my time and energy is channelled to dancing. One thought occurs fairly often to me recently, as I start to see frontier AI models get increasingly intertwined within the lives of the people around me.

        I like a dog at my feet when I read, Whatever his size or whatever his breed. A dog now and then that will nuzzle my hand As though I were the greatest of men in the land, And trying to tell me it’s pleasant to be On such intimate terms with a fellow like me. I like a dog at my side when I eat, I like to give him a bit of my meat; And though mother objects and insists it is bad To let dogs in the dining room, still I am glad To behold him stretched out on the floor by my chair.

I just, I just bought my baby Prada Got another for hеr, straight from the store Fly her &lsquo;round the world so she can hang by the shore That&rsquo;s my baby, that’s my sugar I don&rsquo;t need no honey on the side That&rsquo;s unconditiona-nal For her, I&rsquo;d break the law, just take me straight to the court Buy a billion roses and I&rsquo;d still get her more That&rsquo;s my baby, that’s my sugar I don&rsquo;t need no honey on the side That&rsquo;s unconditiona-nal Alright I&rsquo;ll be honest, the lyrics aren&rsquo;t the most refined.
