<p>Modified from <em>Foundation</em> by Isaac Asimov</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a plane right now with this particular book in hand. To be honest I didn&rsquo;t finish it because it got too boring and confusing, but I tried :p Actually, the flight destination is back to my hometown 郑州 in China, and I told none of my relatives I was coming. So 姥姥， 老爷 and 金刚 will be in for a big surprise. I&rsquo;ve never surprised someone like this before, so I&rsquo;m quite excited to see how they&rsquo;ll react. Hopefully 姥姥 doesn&rsquo;t get too shocked.</p>
<pre><code>An idea just popped into my head of dressing as the deliveryman and seeing if 姥姥，老爷 will recognize me. That will be so funny! And what a wonderful start to the new year.
</code></pre>
<p>I just now recalled a very sweet memory of a recent conversation, that reminded me I am in a transitionary phase. Here&rsquo;s a loose recollection:</p>
<ul class="poetry">
<li>Z (Me): <em>&ldquo;Personally I don&rsquo;t see the point of taking angpaos.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li>A: <em>&ldquo;Whattt but why would you say that?&rdquo;</em></li>
<li>Z: <em>&ldquo;I mean your relatives give some money to you, then your parents give the same amount, or even more, to your relatives&rsquo; kids. So end up is just your parents transfer money to you. Then what&rsquo;s the point? Might as well don&rsquo;t take angpaos, then my parents don&rsquo;t need to waste money giving to me.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>I actually didn't reallyyy think this, because I knew that it's the thought that counts (like your relatives want to give you something), but I still felt bad about taking money from my parents. I always had this thought from a very young age; I don't know why.
</code></pre>
<ul class="poetry">
<li>N: <em>&ldquo;Okay lah then next time you have kids we don&rsquo;t give anything to them&rdquo;</em></li>
<li>M: <em>&ldquo;Eh I don&rsquo;t care ah next time you see our kids you better give them angpao ah and they better take mine&rdquo;</em></li>
<li>Z：<em>“okay okay&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I thought it was so sweet that one day my kids and my friends&rsquo; kids would meet during Chinese New Year, and I (unc) would be handing them angpaos and my friends would hand angpaos to mine =D I can&rsquo;t stop smiling and laughing inside at the thought of us being the annoying uncles and aunties one day. That scene seems so different from now.</p>
<p>But maybe it really isn&rsquo;t. University has just <em>zoomed</em> by, and I&rsquo;m now in my third year with one more year to go. Many of my best friends will graduate soon, and I won&rsquo;t be seeing many of them next academic year. I think I&rsquo;ve experienced this before, but this time it does feel a little different. Like more real? That we are no longer are protected by the school environment and will become &ldquo;proper&rdquo; adults? And how I can&rsquo;t afford to screw around and actually need to start paying the bills and stuff idk. I can totally understand why some people do a PhD for this reason. I would too, but that&rsquo;s more musings for another day. And how back in Singapore I bet many of my friends have already found a life partner and probably have applied to BTO. Idk wtf I&rsquo;m going to do. Idk if I&rsquo;ll apply for a BTO, but my ass is certainly too single to be thinking about that shit. I know life is not a sprint; I know I&rsquo;ll find someone eventually; I know it&rsquo;ll all be fine eventually. Everybody goes through this quarter-life crises phase, and I&rsquo;m sure its normal. But I can&rsquo;t help feeling abit panicked and lonely in this. I think though, as I grow older I&rsquo;ve learnt more about what&rsquo;s actually important so I know I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Edit (January 1st 2026):</em></p>
<p>I think the surprise visit worked! I think I brought a lot of laughter and joy to my entire family. My heart is full. On a side note, I was taking a big fat shit when New Years happened so welp that isn&rsquo;t the best&hellip;</p>
