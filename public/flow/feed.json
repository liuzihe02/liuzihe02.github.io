      "summary": "I like a dog at my feet when I read, Whatever his size or whatever his breed. A dog now and then that will nuzzle my hand As though I were the greatest of men in the land, And trying to tell me it’s pleasant to be On such intimate terms with a fellow like me. I like a dog at my side when I eat, I like to give him a bit of my meat; And though mother objects and insists it is bad To let dogs in the dining room, still I am glad To behold him stretched out on the floor by my chair.",
