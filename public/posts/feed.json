      "title": "The Minority Guessing Game",
      "summary": "I recently learnt a drinking game where you had 2 cards (red/black) for round, and people use these as answers to questions. The goal of the game is to locate who the minority answers came from, and with that came some interesting questions.\nGame Rules $n$ players each hold a red card and a black card. A question is posed each round (e.g., yes/no, would-you-rather, etc.). Each player secretly plays one card to reflect their answer.",

      "summary": "I\u0026rsquo;ve wondered about entropy for a long time. From thermodynamics and the arrow of time, to cross-entropy loss in ML cost functions, or KL divergence in stopping intelligence from going batshit crazy in VAE/PPO, entropy keeps cropping up. Maybe the universe is playing some kinda trick on us here. Since I\u0026rsquo;m taking 3F7 Information Theory, I thought it\u0026rsquo;s probably a good time to understand what these ideas really mean.\nDisclaimer: I do not claim this work to be my own; this is merely a synthesis of intuition and math across multiple resources for myself and anyone interested.",

Slides available here.\nDiscrete Fourier Transform Theory The DFT converts a finite-length time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. For an input signal $x[n]$ of length $N$, where $0 \\le n \\le N-1$, the DFT is defined as:\n$$ X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]\\, W_N^{nk}, \\quad 0 \\le k \\le N-1 \\label{eq:DFT} $$ where $W_N=e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}}$ is the $N$-th principal root of unity, and $X[k]$ is component at frequency $kf_s/N$ with sampling frequency $f_s$.",

I\u0026rsquo;ll provide a brief introduction to the RL setup and explain how GRPO makes traditional algorithims much more efficient. At the end, I\u0026rsquo;ll provide a brief overview of how DeepSeek-R1 was trained. Talk given at Cambridge AI Safety Hub Members Meeting in February, slides available here.\nPreliminaries Transformers Illustration of autoregressive model of transformers, taken from the ARENA curriculum Modern transformers are autoregressive models.",

I wrote a lightweight implementation for tic-tac-toe available here and a super lightweight implementation available here.\nGame Representation A game tree is a tree data structure, where every node represents a distinct state of the game. Given a state $s$, we take an action $a$, and the environment transitions to the new state $s'$ with the transition probability $p_a(s'|s)$.",
