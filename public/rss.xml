      <description>A swallow, generated by GPT. 思念如燕 它飞舞舌尖 若是真爱 配尝几分苦甜 意念婆娑 时间里推磨 追随到何处才结果 燕如针线 在青空缝编 几幅女红将以泪缀点 誓言斑驳 情雾只是经过 风雨中且让我 盈步 婀娜 Olivia Ong/王俪婷&#xA;Recently I did a pretty difficult thing. I put in alot of effort into it, and it paid off. Sure, it came with a couple of trade-offs, but it was well worth it in comparison. I tried really hard to get better at this one other thing (dance), but fell short of my own goals.</description>

      <description>The Fallen Angel by Alexandre Cabanel (Wikipedia) Excerpt from Paradise Lost, by John Milton&#xA;What though the field be lost? All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate, And courage never to submit or yield: And what is else not to be overcome? I didn&amp;rsquo;t read Paradise Lost, but I found this painting of Lucifer that was inspired by Paradise Lost somewhat soul-stirring. We see Lucifer&amp;rsquo;s intense gaze as he looks (at the viewer?</description>

      <description>Composed and written by Jhung&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s always the end when I see things different Always the end when I see you OK last take, last take 2,3 Then you come in like this La-la-la, la-da-da Please! Don&amp;rsquo;t you forget about me, no Cause I can&amp;rsquo;t let this go Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to let me know Nowadays, a significant portion of my time and energy is channelled to dancing. One thought occurs fairly often to me recently, as I start to see frontier AI models get increasingly intertwined within the lives of the people around me.</description>

      <description>I like a dog at my feet when I read, Whatever his size or whatever his breed. A dog now and then that will nuzzle my hand As though I were the greatest of men in the land, And trying to tell me it’s pleasant to be On such intimate terms with a fellow like me. I like a dog at my side when I eat, I like to give him a bit of my meat; And though mother objects and insists it is bad To let dogs in the dining room, still I am glad To behold him stretched out on the floor by my chair.</description>

      <description>Written and composed by Mack David, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston&#xA;A dream is a wish your heart makes When you&amp;rsquo;re fast asleep In dreams, you will lose your heartaches Whatever you wish for, you keep Have faith in your dreams and maybe someday Rainbow will come shining through No matter how your heart is grieving If you keep on believing Then the dream that you wish will come true The original version of this was written for the Walt Disney film Cinderella (1950).</description>

      <title>The Discrete Fourier Transform and Fast Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>We analyze 1 the theoretical properties of both the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the optimized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and estimate their algorithmic complexity.&#xA;All code available on Github. Slides available here.&#xA;Discrete Fourier Transform Theory The DFT converts a finite-length time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. For an input signal $x[n]$ of length $N$, where $0 \le n \le N-1$, the DFT is defined as:&#xA;$$ X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]\, W_N^{kn}, \quad 0 \le k \le N-1 \label{eq:DFT} $$ where $W_N=e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}}$ is the $N$-th principal root of unity, and $X[k]$ is component at frequency $kf_s/N$ with sampling frequency $f_s$.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down DeepSeek R1</title>

      <description>In this post, I want to explore the key RL architecture and software optimizations DeepSeek made to create Deepseek-R1. I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a brief introduction to the RL setup and explain how GRPO makes traditional algorithims much more efficient. At the end, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a brief overview of how DeepSeek-R1 was trained. Talk given at Cambridge AI Safety Hub Members Meeting in February, slides available here.&#xA;Preliminaries Transformers Illustration of autoregressive model of transformers, taken from the ARENA curriculum Modern transformers are autoregressive models.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

      <description>We explain how Monte Carlo Tree Search works and introduce its pseudocode. We borrow notes and figures from int8&amp;rsquo;s website and the MCTS Wikipedia page. I wrote a lightweight implementation for tic-tac-toe available here and a super lightweight implementation available here.&#xA;Game Representation A game tree is a tree data structure, where every node represents a distinct state of the game. Given a state $s$, we take an action $a$, and the environment transitions to the new state $s&#39;$ with the transition probability $p_a(s&#39;|s)$.</description>

      <description>This is an example of a custom shortcode that you can put right into your content. You will need to add a form action to the the shortcode to make it work. Check out Formspark for a simple, free form service.&#xA;Ed theme is not strictly tied to any forms backend. You can easily use any backend like Formspark, Formspree, FabForm and so on just by changing the formAction parameter in the site configuration file.</description>
