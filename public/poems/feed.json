An hour behind the fleeting breath, Later by just an hour than death,— Oh, lagging yesterday! Could she have guessed that it would be; Could but a crier of the glee Have climbed the distant hill; Had not the bliss so slow a pace,— Who knows but this surrendered face Were undefeated still?",

Tú eres fria muñeca de mentira social, y yo, viril destello de la humana verdad.",

O the bleeding drops of red, Where on the deck my Captain lies, Fallen cold and dead. O Captain! my Captain!",
