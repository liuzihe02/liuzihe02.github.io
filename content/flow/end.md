*Composed and written by Jhung*

- It's always the end when I see things different
- Always the end when I see you
- *OK last take, last take*
- *2,3*
- *Then you come in like this*
- La-la-la, la-da-da
- Please!
- Don't you forget about me, no
- Cause I can't let this go
- Don't forget to let me know

Nowadays, a significant portion of my time and energy is channelled to dancing. One thought occurs fairly often to me recently, as I start to see frontier AI models get increasingly intertwined within the lives of the people around me. Perhaps my dance is the very last thing that I can truly call my own. Whatever piece of good quality work I produce nowdays - from supervision answers, code, hell even writing some of these posts - are informed by AI in some way. Especially since my background is in everything AI. But dance is different. I cannot foresee AI generating choreographies anytime soon (certainly not executing them). When I dance, I really do feel the rhythm within me, and getting all the moves on the right beats feels like riding a wave. How I use my body to express the sounds I hear are unique to me. I'm still not sure yet how I feel about this, but I genuinely think my dance is the last thing that'll be taken away by AI.
