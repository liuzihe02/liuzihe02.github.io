- A dream is a wish your heart makes
- When you're fast asleep
- In dreams, you will lose your heartaches
- Whatever you wish for, you keep
{.poetry}
- Have faith in your dreams and maybe someday
- Rainbow will come shining through
- No matter how your heart is grieving
- If you keep on believing
- Then the dream that you wish will come true
{.poetry}

The original version of this was written for the Walt Disney film Cinderella (1950). I however, when I first listened to the [rendition](https://open.spotify.com/track/72mgfo7SWxWi4kmUTuhLPB?si=b7a3a9d5b7fe4a8d) by British artist [Puma Blue](https://www.instagram.com/pumablue/?hl=en), was completely captured by its darker tones and soft vocals. I really did feel like I was in a dream. Some part of me probably knew I was in a dream, but I didn't want to leave.

I find it pretty interesting how the imaginary dreams we experience when we sleep came to be associated with the concrete goals we hope to achieve in reality. I barely dream in my sleep at all, but I think about my goals in reality a lot. Perhaps sometimes even obsessively so.
