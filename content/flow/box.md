*Dear Pat,*

- *You came upon me carving some kind of little figure out of wood, and you said, "Why don't you make something for me?"*
- *I asked you what you wanted, and you said, "A box."*
- *"What for?"*
- *"To put things in."*
- *"What things?"*
- *"Whatever you have," you said.*
- *Well, here's your box. Nearly everything I have is in it, and it is not full. Pain and excitement are in it, and feeling good or bad and evil thoughts and good thoughts—the pleasure of design and some despair and the indescribable joy of creation.*
- *And on top of these are all the gratitude and love I have for you.*
- *And still the box is not full.*

Dedication to Pascal Covici, in John Steinbeck's East of Eden

I was (trying to) read Trenton Bricken's PhD thesis [here](https://www.trentonbricken.com/My-PhD-Thesis/) when I saw this beautiful excerpt from John Steinbeck's novel at the start of his thesis. I thought it was too pretty not to write it somewhere, so I guess this is it. On a side note, I've been slacking off maybe abit too much lately.
