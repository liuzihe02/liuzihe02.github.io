*Composed and written by Jaehyun*

- I just, I just bought my baby Prada
- Got another for hеr, straight from the store
- Fly her 'round the world so she can hang by the shore
- That's my baby, that’s my sugar
- I don't need no honey on the side
- That's unconditiona-nal
- For her, I'd break the law, just take me straight to the court
- Buy a billion roses and I'd still get her more
- That's my baby, that’s my sugar
- I don't need no honey on the side
- That's unconditiona-nal

Alright I'll be honest, the lyrics aren't the most refined. *But* the {{< link src="https://open.spotify.com/track/4j0W96NZvBFqwIyhCb9uGX?si=55b95ea044df4a80" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}song{{< /link >}} is an absolute banger. Some songs make you want to get up and dance, and this song is one of them.

I recently had a very interesting conversation with a friend. We were discussing if unconditional love really exists. Let's put aside defining love for the moment, and use common traits exhibited such as acts of service, willingness to sacrifice for another, concern for another's wellbeing, or acceptance of another. You could say the purest and strongest form of love, exhibited throughout the animal kingdom by both humans and non-humans alike, is a mother's love. After all, any mother would without hesitation put her child before herself, and her child's wellbeing is certainly at the centre of her world. But then my friend raised the point of her love being conditioned on the fact that well, the child is *her* child [^1]. Suppose she was to meet the same child without knowing she is their mother, I'm not sure how she would react.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my mum. But this conversation did get me thinking, is there really such a thing as unconditional love? Maybe all forms of love is really conditioned on something. Between romantic partners, maybe that's physical attraction. Between friends, maybe that's shared values and loyalty. And what about self-love? For most people, our self-love is probably conditioned on meeting certain personal standards, goals, or aesthetic ideals. I find it so weird that even loving ourselves comes with strings attached. I feel like self-love is probably the most important one to come with the least conditions though.

[^1]: Communities like the [Kibbutz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz) communities where children are raised communally and each parent loves all children in the community equally are interesting. But even in this case, I guess the child would still need to be in the community first.
