- I like a dog at my feet when I read,
- Whatever his size or whatever his breed.
- A dog now and then that will nuzzle my hand
- As though I were the greatest of men in the land,
- And trying to tell me it’s pleasant to be
- On such intimate terms with a fellow like me.
{.poetry}
- I like a dog at my side when I eat,
- I like to give him a bit of my meat;
- And though mother objects and insists it is bad
- To let dogs in the dining room, still I am glad
- To behold him stretched out on the floor by my chair.
- It’s cheering to see such a faithful friend there.
{.poetry}
- A dog leads a curious life at the best.
- By the wag of his tail is his pleasure expressed.
- He pays a high tribute to man when he stays
- True to his friend to the end of his days.
- And I wonder sometimes if it happens to be
- That dogs pay no heed of the faults which men see.
{.poetry}
- Should I prove a failure; should I stoop to wrong;
- Be weak at a time when I should have been strong;
- Should I lose my money, the gossips would sneer
- And fill with my blundering many an ear,
- But still, as I opened my door, I should see
- My dog wag his tail with a welcome for me.
{.poetry}

*Edgar A. Guest*

I saw this poem while browsing a poetry shop in Porto. Upon walking into the entrance, I was a little taken aback to see a black Terrier sitting silently atop an armchair, staring intently at me. It then padded smoothly to the entrance, and proceeded to plop itself right beside the door. As if watching over the shop. Streaks of grey lined across the back of its fur making it look much older than it probably was. It then quietly lay its head on the floor, and fixed its eyes on the cobblestone streets. I found him rather calming.

Sometimes I do think about what goes through a dog's mind as it goes about its day. For humans, we're so used to writing, reading and speaking that we often think in terms of natural language. At least for me, I find that when thinking about something I often talk to myself in my head. Only for instinctive actions (like reaching to grab something or opening the door) do I not need to consciously process what I plan to do. So from the dog's perspective, as it's not quite capable of natural language, I wonder if its daily life is dominated by these instinctual thoughts.  When it sees its owner (and clearly there is a sense of attachment), what drives the dog to run up happily to its owner and play with him? You could probably quantify in some way intelligence across the animal kingdom, and I wonder how between species of varying intelligence their perception of the world changes. But regardless of what anyone says about the dog's intelligence, there's certainly something endlessly endearing about the way you are everything to your dog.
