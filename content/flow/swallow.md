- 思念如燕 它飞舞舌尖
- 若是真爱 配尝几分苦甜
- 意念婆娑 时间里推磨
- 追随到何处才结果
- 燕如针线 在青空缝编
- 几幅女红将以泪缀点
- 誓言斑驳 情雾只是经过
- 风雨中且让我 盈步 婀娜
{.poetry}

Recently I did a pretty difficult thing. I put in alot of effort into it, and it paid off. Sure, it came with a couple of trade-offs, but it was well worth it in comparison. I tried really hard to get better at this one other thing (dance), but fell short of my own goals. So I'm a bit at a loss of how to advance on this front, at least for this year. You could say I'm feeling slightly empty, but some people would probably say I'm just being entitled, and I should be grateful for what I already have (rightly so).

But we move. Always.
