title: Flow
---

This is a space to document my thoughts, sometimes seeded by music.

This section is called *flow* for a couple of reasons. My surname *Liu* in chinese *刘* when read aloud, can also interpreted as *流*, which means *flow* or *stream*. If I could describe in one word how I feel in the music and dance that I love, it would exactly be that - *flow*. The way that the movements of my body and the movements of melodies connect both feel like flowing in one continuous stream. In rap music, flow also refers to the rhythms and rhymes of a song's lyrics and how they interact. I do try for these thoughts to have a little bit of flowiness, but much of these will probably be musings. Sometimes a running faucet that someone forgot to turn off, sometimes a quiet stream where you could just sit beside and listen, or (hopefully not) stochastic barfs after a night out...
