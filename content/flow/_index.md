title: Flow

This is a space to document my thoughts around music.

Music occupies a big part of my life, from when I was singing in my school choir, to my current obsession with hip hop dance. Out of any medium (with the possible exception of film), I don't think any medium has generated within me the kind of emotions that music can. Throughout the years, all sorts of sounds - various genres, expressions, and cultures - has been my constant companion. I'm grateful for that. I wanted to dedicate a space to document that experience, and I suppose this is it. Kind of, at least. For now, this space contains song lyrics and how they made me think and feel. Maybe one day, I'll also be able to produce sounds and lyrics of my own that can fill this space.

I named this section *flow* for a few reasons. My surname *Liu* in chinese *刘* when read aloud, can also interpreted as *流*, which means *flow* or *stream*. And if I can describe in one word how I feel in the music and dance that I love, it would exactly be that - *flow*. The way that the movements of my arms and the movements of melodies connect both feel like flowing in one continuous stream. In rap music, flow also refers to the rhythms and rhymes of a song's lyrics and how they interact. I guess many people feel the same way as I do listening to music.
