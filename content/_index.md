# Hey!

<!-- previous decription -->

<!-- Ed is a {{< link src="http://gohugo.io" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Hugo{{< /link >}} theme designed for textual editors based on {{< link src="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}minimal computing principles{{< /link >}}, and focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. Our underlying technology is easy to learn and teach, and can produce beautifully rendered scholarly or reading editions of texts meant to last. To start using Ed, please see [our documentation]({{< relref "/documentation" >}}) for installation instructions and more. To learn more about the ideas behind Ed and a list of current features see our [about]({{< relref "/about" >}}) section. To see Ed in action, we've provided some sample minimal editions for you below. -->

I'm Zihe (or you can call me Zach[^1]). I do computer engineering at the {{< link src="https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/academic-divisions/information-engineering" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}University of Cambridge{{< /link >}}. Most of my time is spent thinking about how frontier AI systems learn, reinforcement learning (RL), and addressing the practical {{< link src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O6quCTEn2L7Xew5IqTx2eYbbSmzgLMdi/view?usp=sharing" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}issues of robustness and reliability in LLMs{{< /link >}}. This is my little corner of the Internet where I talk about what I'm currently obssessed with, cool projects I've worked on, and stuff I've learnt.

## About Me

I'm really curious about why RL works at all, and how the {{< link src="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10760" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}overoptimization{{< /link >}} problem could cause model outputs to become {{< link src="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HQyWGE2BummDCc2Cx/the-case-for-cot-unfaithfulness-is-overstated" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}unintelligible to humans{{< /link >}}. Currently, I'm working on sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Previously, I did {{< link src="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04913" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}some research{{< /link >}} on {{< link src="https://www.matsprogram.org/developmental" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}developmental interpretability{{< /link >}}, where we investigated the high level learning dynamics of Natural Gradient Descent.

I recently interned at {{< link src="https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Singapore's AI Safety Institute{{< /link >}}, where I {{< link src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O6quCTEn2L7Xew5IqTx2eYbbSmzgLMdi/view?usp=sharing" >}}researched{{< /link >}} and {{< link src="https://github.com/liuzihe02/halu" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}benchmarked{{< /link >}} various hallucination detection methods. Last summer, I did the {{< link src="https://www.arena.education/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}ARENA 4.0{{< /link >}} program in London, where we built GPT-2 from scratch and implemented Proximal Policy Optimization to do RLHF. Before that, I deployed computer vision models for object detection and used topic modelling analysis to automate categorization of web feedback at the {{< link src="https://www.changiairport.com/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Changi Airport Group{{< /link >}} ML team.

Singapore is where I call home, and before university I served 2 years in the {{< link src="https://www.mindef.gov.sg/rsaf" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Republic of Singapore Air Force{{< /link >}} as a security trooper. Outside work, you'll probably find me {{< link src="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHhsk8tIxKO/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}dancing{{< /link >}} to hip-hop and R&B music, or rewatching old {{< link src="https://www.criterionchannel.com/world-of-wong-kar-wai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Wong Kar Wai{{< /link >}} films.

[^1]: I actually made this name up on the airplane ride to starting university, so unfortunately it is not my real name...
