Our underlying technology is easy to learn and teach, and can produce beautifully rendered scholarly or reading editions of texts meant to last. To start using Ed, please see [our documentation]({{< relref "/documentation" >}}) for installation instructions and more. To learn more about the ideas behind Ed and a list of current features see our [about]({{< relref "/about" >}}) section.

I'm Liu Zihe (or you can call me Zach). I'm a second year computer engineering undergrad at the University of Cambridge. Most of my time is spent thinking about how frontier AI systems learn, reinforcement learning, and addressing the practical issues of robustness and reliability in LLMs.

This is my little corner of the Internet where I talk about what I'm currently obssessed with, cool projects I've worked on, and stuff I've learnt.
